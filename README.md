# The Invasion

"The Invasion" is a classic arcade-style space shooter developed from the ground up in C++ using the Allegro 5 library. **This project was undertaken during my first semester of college**, serving as a testament to a foundational passion for game development and a drive to learn core programming principles from day one.

## How to Run

1.  Download and unzip the files.
2.  Navigate into the created folder.
3.  Run the `The Invasion.exe` executable to play the game.

## Features

* **Classic Arcade Gameplay:** Survive endless waves of invading enemy ships.

## Development

This game was built as a foundational project to showcase a deep understanding of computer science principles, including:

* Game loop architecture
* 2D rendering and graphics
* Collision detection
* Input handling
* Memory management
* Software design in C and C++

**Remarkably, this entire project was conceived and executed during my first semester, demonstrating an early and dedicated dive into the world of software engineering and game development.**
